# Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate and visualise
the models and strategies implemented in this repository.

Planned notebooks:

- `heston_model_demo.ipynb`  
  Simulate and plot Heston price and variance paths, and inspect the
  distribution of terminal prices.

- `heston_trading_vs_bs.ipynb`  
  Run the mispricing-based trading strategy, visualise the PnL over time,
  and compare it to simple benchmarks (e.g. buy-and-hold or always-long call).
